Marwav! The multiple aspect ratio web app viewer. Just a hack/means of viewing a local or online web app in an assortment of device sizes all at once on one browser (Chrome) page. There are various Chrome extensions that let you view a site in a specifically-sized browser window, but I wanted a page that let me view and fix multiple devices at the same time. 

 - Works great with [Chrome DevTools Autosave](https://github.com/NV/chrome-devtools-autosave) :) 
 - Page will understandably eat up RAM/CPU at times
 - Consider this thing in super alpha state! A developer testing tool only for now ...
