MARWAV!

The multiple aspect ratio web app viewer. 

This is just a hack/means of viewing a local or online web app in an assortment of device sizes all at once on one browser (Chrome) page. There are various Chrome extensions that let you view a site in a specifically-sized browser window, but I wanted a page that let me view and fix multiple devices at the same time. 

 - Works great with [Chrome DevTools Autosave](https://github.com/NV/chrome-devtools-autosave) :) 
 - This thing does have capacity to eat up fair amount of RAM/CPU - but most modern dev machines should be fine
 - The "Rotate" button and the Zoom/scale feature are both unfinished/buggy but do work partially.
 - Current device sizes integrated:
  - iPad
  - iPhone 3GS
  - iPhone 5
  - Nexus One
  - Galaxy Nexus
  - Galaxy S 3/4

Consider this thing in super alpha state! A developer testing tool only for now ...
